About Ascension Hypnotherapy & Wellness
Ascension Hypnotherapy & Wellness is a sacred space for transformation, self-discovery, and energetic alignment. Founded by Certified Hypnotherapist Karen Elizabeth Beck, our mission is to guide individuals through inner healing journeys using advanced hypnotherapy, spiritual insight, and vibrational tools.

Our digital platform reflects our core belief: that healing is not just mental or emotional — it is energetic. Through custom-built client portals, chakra tracking, affirmation tools, and intuitive quizzes, we empower each client to unlock their highest self and live in harmony with the universe.

Rooted in heart-centered service and inspired by the mystical experience of vortex energy, Ascension Hypnotherapy offers more than sessions — we offer a path to ascension.
